# RFID_CLONER
Hacking ⚠️ Into RFID Using Arduino 

RFID or Radio-frequency identification is the use of radio waves to read and capture information stored on a tag attached to an object.

In this video, you'll learn how to use your Arduino as an RFID cloner/reader where you'll be able to clone a 13.56Mhz RFID tag/card and then use your new RFID tag to (open the garage door/gain physical and logical access control).
